# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Neccessary Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install --save react react-dom react-scripts`

Installs all dependencies needed for this app.

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

No need to open two terminals. This script runs both - the react app and server where are data stored. Saved changes refresh the app automaticaly. 

The app provides you with a few todos, you can delete, edit or actually complete them.
